If an ATOL holder fails, the ATOL scheme ensures customers contracted with the ATOL holder are repatriated back to the UK or reimbursed for travel that has not yet taken place. Affinion Travel hold an ATOL licence and when purchasing travel that includes air and accommodation that has been packaged together by us or sold as a flight-plus arrangement you will be protected under our licence (ATOL number 9935). We also act as an authorised agent for a number of tour operators who will hold their own ATOL licence, and when purchasing a tour operator package you will be protected by their licence. The tour operator invoice you receive will detail the operator's ATOL number. For more information visit the ATOL website at www.atol.org.uk.\n\nAffinion International Travel is selling airline tickets as an agent. Such flight-only tickets are not protected under the ATOL scheme and so in order to provide you with protection, Affinion has taken out a Scheduled Airline Failure Insurance (SAFI) policy for the benefit of all its flight-only customers. This policy provides us with £2000 of cover per ticket in the event of an airline failing due to insolvency. We will re-imburse you the total price of your ticket up to £2000 in the event of such failure. A charge of £2.50 per ticket will be added to your invoice to cover the cost of this insurance to Affinion.",
