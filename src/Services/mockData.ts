With your Black Mobile Phone Insurance, your phone is covered for accidental damage, theft, loss and breakdown (once your manufacturer's warranty has expired). Cover applies worldwide.\n\nWeâ€™ll settle claims by replacing, or, in certain circumstances, repairing your phone. Our replacement phones are refurbished using genuine manufacturer parts and will be in an \"as new\" condition. If you choose a repair option, any repairs will use genuine manufacturer or manufacturer quality parts.\n\nPlease remember your mobile phone insurance covers the phone you use on a daily basis and if applicable, the phones used on a daily basis by your partner (who lives with you in a domestic relationship, whether married or cohabiting) and/or your children under 18 years of age who live at home with you (under 23 if still in full time education and living with you outside of term time).\n\nThere is no cover for phones owned by your employer.\n\nMobile phone insurance is underwritten by American International Group UK Limited (AIG) and provided by Brightstar Insurance Services, B.V.
